# redpanda-injection-tool
# this is my first program so go easy on it its not optimized and messy im aware.
# I created this tool to automate the webpage injection for the RedPanda Box on HTB it prints the curl command just fine but when I try to have the python script execute it automatically it fails dont know why but ive spent well over 10 hours so im gonna post what I have and finish the box. FYI theres probably a simple fix using pycurl 

# this program runs all text you type through the java ASCII table and then compiles a completed command that allows for simple but effective java injection
